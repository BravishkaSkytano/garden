It is an unforgettable, in-depth journey through all 39 books of the Old Testament. It follows the flow of biblical history from creation to the Transjordan, from the Conquest to the Babylonian Exile, and the Pre-exilic and Exilic Prophets. Special attention is given to how God has always related to his people through covenant–and how grace has been the cornerstone of God’s dealings with humanity since the very beginning. Students gain eye-opening insights into the culture, traditions, and prevailing religious views which enable them to fully grasp the enormity and profundity of Jesus the Messiah’s mind and message.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-objectives\">Learning Objectives<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#learning-objectives\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>State the basic storyline of the Old Testament and be familiar with the major events, people, and geographical locations of ancient Israel.</li>\n<li>Be able to articulate the themes, purpose, and primary message of each individual book of the Old Testament.</li>\n<li>Identify the various ways in which the Old Testament testifies about Jesus Christ and grow closer to the Savior by gaining insights into the salvation-historical preparations for his birth, teachings, crucifixion, and resurrection.</li>\n<li>Apply interpretive skill to Old Testament readings of different literary genres in light of the major covenants and historical periods.</li>\n<li>Trust the Bible, live holy lives, and be evangelists.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"section-1-from-creation-to-the-transjordan\">Section 1: From Creation to the Transjordan<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#section-1-from-creation-to-the-transjordan\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the basic elements of a Judeo-Christian worldview.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate a working knowledge of the visual roadmap of the timeline of the entire biblical narrative.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate skill at being able to identify and understand key contributions the Hebrew people have made in the shaping of western civilization with particular emphasis on its moral categories.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the important theme of covenant in God’s dealings with His people and creation.</li>\n<li>Identify the importance of the Pentateuch in the history of the Hebrew people and Judaism.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"section-2-from-the-conquest-to-the-babylonian-exile\">Section 2: From the Conquest to the Babylonian Exile<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#section-2-from-the-conquest-to-the-babylonian-exile\"></a></h3>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Yoela's Garden","desc":"","updated":1728743963747,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"},"contentHash":"ae2a8a5da1925caba2d4a39ffbc7d28f","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["wsv54z6fb6pyr9l8y3kv8li","36im6j46cxlgm7yqwfsy0sy","tqb5hhhvpbz2nzpykihc7l2","cyzf7ekzgc9m43pfwa3kv5e"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my digital garden! What's that? Well, a digital garden is a curated set of notes, often shared online for learning and sharing purposes. My garden is mostly full of my study notes, plain ole' random notes, prose, and whatever world I'm creating at the moment. So, yes, I'm tending to it nearly every day.\n\nWith that out of the way, just a fair warning, not everything in this garden will make sense to you. There are some sections that are… shall we say, little buds that need a bit more watering and time before they're big enough to actually portray their species. To help you (and me) figure out the growth status of a page, there are emojis on every one that show their current state within the garden.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Yoela's Garden","description":"Personal Knowledge Space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","assetsPrefix":"/garden","siteUrl":"https://bravishkaskytano.github.io","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
