Fictional portrayals are thus inconsistent with history, fact, or plausibility. In a traditional narrow sense, \"fiction\" refers to written narratives in prose – often referring specifically to novels, novellas, and short stories. More broadly, however, fiction encompasses imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/garden/notes/7o4x1koo1ybckn6wkwzrx69\">Light in the Shadows</a></li>\n</ol>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Yoela's Garden","desc":"","updated":1728743963747,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"},"contentHash":"ae2a8a5da1925caba2d4a39ffbc7d28f","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["wsv54z6fb6pyr9l8y3kv8li","36im6j46cxlgm7yqwfsy0sy","tqb5hhhvpbz2nzpykihc7l2","cyzf7ekzgc9m43pfwa3kv5e"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my digital garden! What's that? Well, a digital garden is a curated set of notes, often shared online for learning and sharing purposes. My garden is mostly full of my study notes, plain ole' random notes, prose, and whatever world I'm creating at the moment. So, yes, I'm tending to it nearly every day.\n\nWith that out of the way, just a fair warning, not everything in this garden will make sense to you. There are some sections that are… shall we say, little buds that need a bit more watering and time before they're big enough to actually portray their species. To help you (and me) figure out the growth status of a page, there are emojis on every one that show their current state within the garden.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Yoela's Garden","description":"Personal Knowledge Space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","assetsPrefix":"/garden","siteUrl":"https://bravishkaskytano.github.io","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
