Front-end developers work on what is visible by the app user, by using [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]].

Rules are split into 3 levels: junior, intermediate, and senior.

Backend developers work on the behind-the-scenes portion of the web app, such as web servers, database, and architecture. They work with backend languages, databases, APIs, and web servers.

Back-end development requires more knowledge and time.

Full-stack developers are proficient with front-end and back-end work. This includes the planning, architecture, design, development, deployment, and maintenance of the website or app.

Full-stack development roles are senior positions due to the high levels of experience required.
