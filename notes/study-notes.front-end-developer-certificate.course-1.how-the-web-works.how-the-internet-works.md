2+ devices connect to each other, either wired or wireless, to form a [[network]].

[[Network switches]] allow you to connect multiple devices, and even other networks to each other.

Then, they connect to other network switches to form an [[interconnected network]], otherwise known as the internet.

Computers that host content for the internet are called [[servers]], and the devices we use to connect to these servers are called [[clients]]. This is known as the [[client-server model]].
