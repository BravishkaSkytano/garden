<p>Welcome to my digital garden! What's that? Well, a digital garden is a curated set of notes, often shared online for learning and sharing purposes. My garden is mostly full of my study notes, plain ole' random notes, prose, and whatever world I'm creating at the moment. So, yes, I'm tending to it nearly every day.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, just a fair warning, not everything in this garden will make sense to you. There are some sections that areâ€¦ shall we say, little buds that need a bit more watering and time before they're big enough to actually portray their species. To help you (and me) figure out the growth status of a page, there are emojis on every one that show their current state within the garden.</p>
